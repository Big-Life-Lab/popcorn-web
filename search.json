    "text": "Population Health Modelling Consensus Reporting Network for Noncommunicable Diseases (POPCORN-NCD)\nDeveloping an internationally agreed-upon reporting guideline for studies that model noncommunicable diseases.\n\n\nWe’re developing POPCORN, a new reporting guideline to improve the consistency and transparency of research using models to address noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes. Following the successful EQUATOR approach, POPCORN will help researchers, policymakers, and the public better understand these models and make informed health decisions (EQUATOR registration).\nThis study is in its early stages. Our international team has reviewed reporting frameworks and guidelines, and surveyed modellers, journal editors, and knowledge users. 98% of respondents agreed there is a need for a new reporting guideline (1–3). The need has strengthened following the pandemic, which highlighted the role of transparent models in informing policymaking and building public trust.\nWe welcome your collaboration and contributions to ensure POPCORN’s success.\nContact: Doug Manuel, Senior Scientist, The Ottawa Hosptial (dmanuel@ohri.ca)\n\nReferences\n\n\n1.
